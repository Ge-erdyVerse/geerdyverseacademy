<h1>Why <em>Dhurandhar</em> Works</h1>

<img

<p>
There’s a certain kind of cinematic hook that seasoned writers are warned against—the kind that gives away too much, too soon. The kind that places massive stakes right at the beginning, almost daring the rest of the film to keep up. <em>Dhurandhar</em> opens exactly like that. A blunt, almost “cheap” hook. The sort many screenwriting books would tell you to avoid.
</p>

<p>
And yet, at this point—after watching thousands of films—I’ve come to accept this as an <em>Indian hook system</em>. Not inherently flawed, just different.
</p>

<p>
Where Western thrillers often excel is in restraint. They build stakes slowly, methodically, allowing tension to accumulate like pressure in a sealed room. Indian thrillers, on the other hand, often choose to detonate the bomb in the opening minutes—establishing sky-high stakes immediately—and then spend the rest of the runtime trying to claw their way back to that same intensity.
</p>

<p>Most fail.</p>

<p><em>Dhurandhar</em> doesn’t.</p>

<h2>The Problem With High-Stakes Openings in Indian Thrillers</h2>

<p>
The typical structure goes like this:<br>
Start with an explosive, life-altering event.<br>
Then sink into a long, bloated middle filled with exposition, backstory, and emotional reiteration.<br>
Finally, panic—and rush the climax to recreate the opening’s intensity.
</p>

<p>
This approach destroys pacing. The middle becomes a dead zone. Stakes collapse. Emotional momentum evaporates.
</p>

<p>
What makes <em>Dhurandhar</em> stand apart is how <em>Aditya</em>—clearly a filmmaker who understands rhythm more than formula—handles this rebuilding phase. Instead of inflating the middle with explanations, he does the opposite. He <em>lowers</em> the stakes deliberately, bringing them all the way down to the ground after launching them into the sky.
</p>

<p>
That decision is what makes the film breathe.
</p>

<h2>Rebuilding Stakes Without Killing Pacing</h2>

<p>
Most writers mistake rebuilding for slowing down. They drown the audience in backstory, flashbacks, and heavy-handed emotional beats. <em>Dhurandhar</em> refuses to do that. It gives you <em>glimpses</em>, not lectures.
</p>

<p>
You’re never told everything. You’re shown just enough.
</p>

<p>
Characters are sketched through behavior, not speeches. Motivations are implied, not announced. This restraint keeps the pacing razor-sharp. The film never feels like it’s stalling, even when it’s quiet.
</p>

<p>
That’s the genius of it: the middle doesn’t feel like a pause—it feels like a tightening coil.
</p>

<h2>The Second Hook: A Masterclass in Tonal Shift</h2>

<p>
Then comes the second hook—the 26/11 sequence.
</p>

<p>
This is where most films would collapse under their own ambition. A sudden tonal shift of that magnitude can feel manipulative or jarring if mishandled. Shock without setup often loses its power.
</p>

<p>
But here, the groundwork has already been laid.
</p>

<p>
Before the shift, we’re given a small but crucial narrative thread: Dakait attempting to dirty his hands in politics. It’s not a subplot—it’s a pivot. A subtle redirection of his character arc.
</p>

<p>
Until this point, Dakait is driven by revenge. Now, his motivation mutates into something more corrosive: the desire to <em>hold onto power</em>. Power that was born from loss. Power that took away his child.
</p>

<p>
That shift changes how we perceive him. It quietly tells the audience: something is about to break.
</p>

<p>
And when it does, the pacing doesn’t stumble—it <em>explodes</em> forward.
</p>

<p>
This is where <em>Dhurandhar</em> becomes pure cinema. Momentum, tone, and character alignment snap into place simultaneously. That kind of precision doesn’t come from clever writing tricks—it comes from love for the medium.
</p>

<p>
Only someone who genuinely loves making films can pull this off.
</p>

<h2>Dakait, Hamza, and the Weight of Guilt</h2>

<p>
The final chapter elevates the film from a strong thriller to something far more unsettling.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Macbeth</em> and <em>Julius Caesar</em> parallels are not decorative—they’re structural. The betrayal isn’t just a plot device; it’s a moral reckoning.
</p>

<p>“Et tu, Brute?”</p>

<p>
The question isn’t whether Dakait lives or dies. That ambiguity is intentional. The real revelation is what the betrayal exposes.
</p>

<p>Hamza is no hero.</p>

<p>
Beneath his composed exterior lies a mountain of guilt—guilt he’s been hiding behind duty, ideology, and self-righteousness. Dakait becomes part of that guilt, just as Dakait himself carries the burden of losing his humanity piece by piece.
</p>

<p>
This dual descent is what gives the ending its haunting power. There’s no catharsis. No clean resolution. Just moral rot spreading quietly through everyone involved.
</p>

<p>
And that’s why audiences left the theater asking the “wrong” question—<em>Is Dakait alive or dead?</em>
</p>

<p>
The film doesn’t care about that answer.
</p>

<p>
It wants you to sit with the discomfort.
</p>

<h2>Why the Ending Works Where Others Rush</h2>

<p>
Many long Indian films sabotage themselves by slowing the middle too much and sprinting through the ending. <em>Dhurandhar</em> never does that. The climax feels earned because the film never lost control of its rhythm.
</p>

<p>
Every choice feels intentional. Every silence matters.
</p>

<p>
The ending doesn’t shout. It lingers.
</p>

<p>
And that lingering is far more powerful than any definitive answer.
</p>

<h2>Standing Above the Genre</h2>

<p>
The last Indian spy thriller I truly enjoyed before this was <em>Baby</em>. It was tight, focused, and confident in its storytelling.
</p>

<p>
But <em>Dhurandhar</em> surpasses it—handsomely.
</p>

<p>
Not because it’s louder. Not because it’s darker. But because it understands something many thrillers forget:<br>
<strong>Stakes don’t come from scale. They come from control.</strong>
</p>

<p>
<em>Dhurandhar</em> controls its pacing, its information, and its moral ambiguity with surgical precision. It respects the audience enough to not over-explain. It trusts silence. It trusts implication.
</p>

<p>
And most importantly, it trusts cinema.
</p>

<p>
That’s why <em>Dhurandhar</em> works.
